# GANs and Diffusion

This project explores image generation using generative models, with a focus on understanding how they work under the hood and how to implement them from scratch. The goal is to experiment with different model architectures and training strategies to perform image generation both with and without conditioning (as illustrated in the image above, which shows a generation conditioned by another image).

The work was carried out using an interactive Jupyter notebook, which combines:

- Code implementations of core generative techniques.
- Explanatory notes and reflections to demonstrate a clear understanding of key concepts.
- Hands-on exercises where models are built or completed to explore practical aspects of training generative models.

This project was an opportunity to strengthen my understanding of generative AI through practical implementation, critical thinking, and iterative experimentation—all documented in a single, cohesive notebook.

If you’re having trouble viewing the Jupyter notebook, you can open the PDF version generated from it.
